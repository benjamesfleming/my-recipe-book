-   1 tsp baking powder
-   2 tsp vanilla

### Steps:

**First bowl**

-   Whisk the egg whites until firm and form stiff peaks.

**Second bowl**

-   Mix the egg yolks, almond flour, sweetener, and baking powder.
-   Add the melted butter slowly, mixing to ensure it is a smooth consistency.
-   Add the milk and vanilla, mix well.
-   Gently fold spoons of the whisked egg whites into the yolk mixture. Try to keep as much of the air and fluffiness as possible.
