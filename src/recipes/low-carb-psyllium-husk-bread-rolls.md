### Ingredients:

- 4 tbsp boiling water

**Dry Ingredients**

- 3/4 cup (100 g) almond flour
- 2 tbsp psyllium husk powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp black sesame seeds
- 1 tsp white sesame seeds
- 2 tsp sunflower seeds
- 1 tsp black chia seeds
- 1/2 tsp Himalayan salt
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder

**Wet Ingredients**

- 1 egg
- 2 egg whites
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 3 tbsp melted refined coconut oil

### Steps:

- Preheat the oven to 180C.
- In a bowl, mix the dry ingredients with a whisk. In a separate bowl, mix the wet ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a silicone spatula.
- Slowly pour in the boiling water and continue mixing. The dough will be quite thick and expand as it absorbs the water.
- Separate the dough into 5 and form 5 balls with your hands (the batter is pretty sticky). **You can spray some olive oil on your hands to make the dough not stick to you.**
- Place the balls over parchment paper on a baking tray and bake for 30 minutes. Take out and let cool before serving or you'll burn your fingers! These come out piping hot!
